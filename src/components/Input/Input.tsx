// 2. Input Field Component: Implement an Input Field component that includes
// different states (default, focus, error) and types (text, email, password, etc.).

// Design Principles:
// Component Design: Each component should be self-contained and reusable. It
// should accept props to modify its behavior or style.

// Scalability: The library should be designed in a way that new components can be
// easily added in the future.

// Testing: Write unit tests for your components using a testing library of your choice
// (Jest, React Testing Library, etc.). Ensure all major functionality is covered.

// Responsive Design: The components should be responsive and work well on
// different screen sizes.

// Accessibility: The components are usable via keyboard navigation and contain
// appropriate properties.

  return <div>Input</div>;
